# Electronic-Air-Rifle-Target
 The Python Target System is an efficient solution for target shooting. It displays a real-time target image, representing shots as circles. The system communicates with an API to fetch shot coordinates, dynamically updating the image. Multiple shots are supported, with the last shot highlighted in red. The interface is user-friendly.
